ParallelR is a platform for on-demand distributed, parallel computing, specified with R language. We provide out-of-box support in memory efficient implementation, code parallelization and high-performance computing for R as well as related technologies in data analyst, machine learning and AI.

To take advantage of the hardware, we combined R applications with modern hardware architectures, such as multi-cores CPU and/or NVIDIA GPU. It can significantly accelerate the performance of your R codes and scale up to meet the requirement of big data input and resolve your problem by very complex models. So,our infrastructure can improve productivity, and save your time and money!

ParallelR is curated and maintained by a group of top engineers working in scientific computing, statistical analysis, and quantitative analysis, and we are experienced in parallelization, performance modelling and architecture-specific tuning for R language.
