Software developers and statistical researchers are looking to increase their skills in writing or optimizing applications for highly parallel processing in R under modest hardware and software frames. In training section, we post series talks and slides for the state of the art in performance optimization and parallelization for various programming models, such as OpenMP, MPI, CUDA (OpenCL) and Hadoop. Furthermore, we will use real cases of the industry to show how to apply these programming skills to resolve your problems..
